Check in on Tetazoo's favorite cat

This is a project I'm currently working on, to remake an old iRobot create into a Raspberry Pi powered, open-source, robot "cat" for my dorm floor. The end goal is to have a robot pet that can navigate autonomously and display its needs and recent interactions online for anyone to see.
