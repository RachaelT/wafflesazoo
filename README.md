Check in on Tetazoo's favorite cat! wafflesazoo.mit.edu


This is a project I'm currently working on, to remake an old Roomba (really an iRobot Create) into a Raspberry Pi and Arduino powered robot "cat" for my dorm's hall. The end goal is to have a robot pet that can navigate autonomously and display its needs and recent interactions online for anyone to see. 

Here's a picture of Waffles, in its current form:

The "cat" can be petted by stroking the touchscreen, which affects its mood. These changes are propogated to the Wafflesazoo website, where you can check in and see how Waffles is doing. You can also see what Waffles has posted on Zephyr (a terminal-based chat client used at MIT). The cat can also roam around and navigate past obstacles using the Roomba's bump sensors.

As of February 2017, I've acquired a Neato LiDAR, and my next goal is to get it working with the Raspberry Pi, so that Waffles can perform more sophisticated navigation.
